## How to build website from source
```
$ make html         # Build static site on local machine, in output/ folder
$ make serve        # Serve website locally (runs in background). To view, point your favorite browser to: localhost:8000
```

To push any local changes to the real site, just do:
```
$ SSH_USER=____ SSH_HOST=____ SSH_TARGET_DIR=____  make rsync_upload 
```

This will upload the files to SSH_USER@SSH_HOST:SSH_TARGET_DIR via rsync.
