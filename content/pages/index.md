        Jan 2020: Launch of the T-TRIPODS Institute across Tufts
    </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      We are launching a new campus-wide initiative: The Tufts Transdisciplinary Research In Principles of Data Science Institute (T-TRIPODS). This will bring together interdisciplinary research across departments and schools at Tufts to advance the understanding of foundations of data science, with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The focus is on fostering collaboration between core methodologists in the CS, ECE, and Math departments on three targeted methodological areas: graph and tensor representations, spatiotemporal modeling, and providing assurances of quality, fairness, privacy and trust. The institute will also push those advances to impact key application areas across the university.

        Feb 2019: Linfeng Liu's paper on amortized inference for Gaussian processes is published at AISTATS 2019  
    </h5>
    <p class="card-text">The paper "Amortized Variational Inference with Graph Convolutional
    Networks for Gaussian Processes" [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/liu19c/liu19c.pdf">link</a>] proposes a new efficient inference method for Gaussian processes. It decomposes the inference task into sub-tasks at local neighborhoods and use a shared inference network to amortize computation cost.
